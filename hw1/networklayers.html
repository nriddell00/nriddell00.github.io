    <q> What is the Network?</q>

    <p>
        The network is a collection of devices that are connected together to share resources and information. 
        The network is made up of different layers that work together to provide communication and data transfer between devices. 
        The layers of the network are the physical layer, the data link layer, the network layer, the transport layer, the session layer, the presentation layer, and the application layer.
    </p>

    <p>
        The OSI model is a conceptual framework that describes how data is transmitted over a network. It runs from top to bottom when it sends data and from bottom to top when it receives data.
        The application layer is exactly what it sounds like, it's the application that you see on your screen.
        The presentation and session layers aren't as important as the other layers, but they are still necessary for the network to function properly.
        The transport layer is responsible for ensuring that data is delivered reliably and in the correct order. The network layer is responsible for routing data between devices on the network.
        The data link layer is responsible for providing error-free communication between devices on the same network. The physical layer is responsible for transmitting data over the physical medium, such as a cable or wireless signal.
